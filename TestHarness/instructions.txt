To run one version of your program against another configure it like so:

1. Set your program to take 2 arguments
    a. If Args[1] = "test",  continue to a test execution where the stdOuts/StdIns are minimal
    b. If Args[2] = "false", take user input before calling minimax (e.g. "human" goes first)
       If Args[2] = "true", let your program go first
2. Have minimal stdOuts/stdIns. Only output the move your program made and only input the move the "human" made
3. Compile your program into an executable or multiple executables to play against each other
4. Place the TestHarness executable into the same folder as the other executables
5. Run the TestHarness and follow the prompts
